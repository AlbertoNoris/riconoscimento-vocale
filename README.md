# About

This repository contains my bachelor degree's thesis with the title: "Riconoscimento vocale per Robot" which in english stands for: "Speech recognition for Robots".

The entire project was designed to be discussed in italian so there may be some cases where google translate might be needed but other than that the code is english based so if you manage to follow the instructions you can test it by speaking english.

These are the steps in order to install it:

# Install
This is designed to run on Linux 18.04 so having this version should be sufficient but not necessary.



1. download these [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/releases/download/v0.3.30/vosk-linux-x86-0.3.30.zip) extract them and put the `libvosk.so` in the /lib folder

open the terminal and type these comands

2. `git clone https://github.com/AlbertoNoris/riconoscimento-vocale.git`

3. `cd riconoscimento-vocale`

4. `./comprensore`

5. `./microfono.py`

the program should be up and running and you can test it by saying phrases like "ok robot go to the door" or "ok robot turn fifteen degrees and go to the window"
